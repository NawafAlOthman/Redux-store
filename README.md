# Nawaf's Candy Store

Welcome to Nawaf's Candy Store! This project was created as a learning exercise for working with Redux. Please note that this is not a real candy store website but a simulation for practicing Redux concepts.

## Project Overview

Nawaf's Candy Store is a web application that allows users to explore a diverse range of virtual candy selections. Users can interact with the website to get a simulated experience of adding and removing various types of candies from the store into their shopping cart. This project primarily focuses on showcasing how Redux can be used to manage and manipulate the state of the candy selection.

## Features

- **Candy Selection:** Users can browse through an assortment of virtual candies, each with its unique name, description, and price.

- **Add to Cart:** By clicking the "Add to Cart" button on a specific candy item, users can add it to their shopping cart.

- **Remove from Cart:** If a user changes their mind, they can easily remove candies from their cart by clicking the "Remove" button.

- **Inventory Management:** The availability of candies is managed using Redux. When a particular candy runs out of stock, it is reflected accordingly in the shop.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The user interface of Nawaf's Candy Store is built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for users.

- **Redux:** Redux is used to manage the state of the application, specifically for handling the candy inventory and shopping cart.

- **HTML/CSS:** Basic HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the website.
